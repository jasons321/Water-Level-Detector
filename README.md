# Water-Level-Detector
For a physics research project investigating how the height of water level affect the flow rate of water through an orifice, there must be a way where the level of water can be measured accurately. The most obvious method would be to measure the time that the water level reaches a certain level by eye, but this would introduce additional errors and bias into the experiment. To mitigate this, I developed a device that uses Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor to gauge the distance between the device and the level of water. 

Note: A detailed write up about this experiment can be found in physics.pdf attached. 

## Set-up Explanation 

The ultrasonic sensor emits a high frequency sound and it records the time taken to receive the reflected sound wave when an object or surface is detected.
